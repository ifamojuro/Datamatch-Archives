# PINKER Notes:
- right now the algorithm is based on similarity:
  - promit:
    - assuming that similarity
    - assorted of meeting : likes attract
  - promit: bucket system
    - taking it for fun?
    - short term hook up vs. long term relationships
    - short term -> looks/ especially for men; 
    - dating sites
    - helen fisher
    - dataclism, by chris rudder: okay cupid
    - looks matter a lot for gay male meeting market; gay women -> not necessarily looks
  - desirability: what you want and who wants you is different
    - how to solve that problem: 
    - research medical internship /interns matches
  - blind date
    - chris rudder
  - helen fisher : 
  - david bus
    - love sex and attraction
- HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP?
  - more serious? less serious?
  - untinder
  - the reasons we are doing “untinder”
    - this is not hook-up; interested in personal connection
  - robert chaldinee? 
    - how to persuade people??
    - giving information of what other people do;
- how to convince people go on dates
- can we use your name
  - *DESIGNED WITH FEEDBACK FROM STEVEN PINKER!*

- we are the UNTINDER
  - beyond tinder, not just tinder
- what are the chances that you like best is in your class? in your dining hall? in your math 55 class?
- why settle for the tiny random sample to bump into?
- google scholar -> attraction, romantic compatibility, mating, 
  - recent meta analysis
  - literature; recent books by fisher and rudder
  - read on that!
  - similarities vs. opposites attract
  - liberal/ personality/ high strong
  - laid back/ vs. laid back
  - what should we weight more heavily?
- best thing: making it data driven; for people who went on the dates: 
- database of questions: who responded to their match; which questions -> predict who went on matches?
- what pattern of question similarities -> cause them to actually go on the dates?
- blind data match
  - dating sites show that blind dates are more successful
