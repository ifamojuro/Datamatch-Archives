Meeting w/Harnek 10-23

Prize Dates
 - Harnek does not feel comfortable funding a dinner based on a social media competition, where you have to go on a date with a rando (your match).
 - He said that there would be some funding for a "lotteried" dinner, where everyone who takes Datamatch has a chance to win a dinner, and they can take anyone with them.
 - He agreed that UC funding is probably a good way to go.
