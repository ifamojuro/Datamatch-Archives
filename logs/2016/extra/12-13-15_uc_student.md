# 12-13-15 Meeting with UC Student Initiatives

- Meeting in Lowell DHall between Raynor Kuang and Maddy Stern
- In review: meetings with former head Danny, prezzes

- 2 ideas:
  - UC Funding (additional outings)
  - Meet-Up afterwards sponsored by UC (like a coffee meeting)

- UC Funding
  - Retroactive: cut a check for money spent
  - Wouldn't be very popular for UC to straight up subsidize
  - UC branding is most popular part
    - the little badge :D
    - *"endorsement process"*
    - UC powered mail merge
  - Maddy likes:
    - Increasing what people can get on a date
    - Allowing second dates (more matches in general)
    - basically not something where UC just throws money at us and we abscond with it

- Meet-up afterward:
  - Raffle contest: one entry per every meetup with matches
    - prizes: expensive dates, dinners
      - problem with pair-assumed dinners: logistically problematic to decide who wins, who gets prize
  - Problematic to arrange matches with an additional "button" also for meet-up
    - Could people just go alone?
    - difficult to confirm 
  - Speed-dating
    - commitment is a big problem
    - hard to organize
  - Overall:
    - organizing is difficult if focus is entirely on pairs  
    - might work best as freely open event to the Harvard community (even those not particip. in DM)
    - UC organized, but HCS pubbed (a mention afterward on website)
    - where to fit in between subsidizing and Valgrind?

- Valgrind
  - UC can't officially sponsor "alcohol"
  - UC planning might be helpful for organizing an actual successful party
    - the ill-memories of Memory Leak...
  - possible replacement for the "meet-up?"
  - TODO: talk to board and see if they actually want UC involvement
  
- Final thoughts:
  - a little messy with three different events
  - endorsement/mail merge
  - subdizing vs. own UC event vs. valgrind
