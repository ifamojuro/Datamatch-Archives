# 1/13/16 Board Meeting Notes
Outline + Notes for meeting with Harnek Gulati (Pres.) and other members of HCS Board over Skype on 1/13/16

# Outline
## First Things First...
- How long are people planning to be on this call?
- Remind me of new board roles
- Best way to orient this meeting is probably to focus on implementation
- of decided changes, rather than brainstorming yet more new initiatives
  - Likewise, medium sized pushes, rather than fine details or large abstracts

## Website
- Along with backend, I'll gloss over this; faster to leave implementation up to team
  - If board has any pressing concerns/questions, mention them, but otherwise we'll come back to it at end

- New appearance/CSS
- Login
  - Gotta email Malan...

- Search, archives,
  - Any pressing new features?

- FB features (in order of importance, priority)
  - Share scores
  - Share website
  - Direct messaging

## Algorithm
- Fundamentally same as previous years
- Cleaner code
- More of an impetus to base matching on serious questions, user traits

## Business
- UC Partnership
  - UC Funding (most likely option)
    - estimates for needed money?
    - amount UC can provide?

  - UC Event
    - UC against (too complicated)
      1. Additional UC speed-date event
      2. UC help with Valgrind

  - Mail-merge: access to UC mailing list
  - UC Branding
    - simple: just some inclusions of "UC Partnered" and UC Logo

- Restaurants
  - Zinnekin's
    - estimated cost?
    - allow waffles for 2nd top date?
    - other logistics issues?
    - max 30 dates a day--what leeway does this give us?

  - Berryline
    - estimated cost?
    - allow for only 2nd top date, or as choice between Zinn's for 1st?

  - Other benefits/restaurants?
  - see UC funding bullet

- Valgrind
  - Who's in charge?
  - CONCRETE, specific date?
  - Pubbed ahead of time!!
  - logistics issues? (capacity, drinks, cost)

  - mixer beforehand
    - "Nerdy SocialNetwork-like Hackathon mixer"

  - see UC event bullet

- Other initiatives
  - None planned by DM team
  - Any by the

- Survey Results
  - share results with other people in meeting
  - pubbing results:
    - list emails by far the most effective: focus on writing good emails
    - friends second: already good here
    - social media third: even a minor social media could have lots of benefits?

  - matches
    - substantial support for at least some serious questions
      - "Would you be uncomfortable..."

    - moderate support for way to contact matches
      - event (Valgrind!)
      - chat (less doable: see Jason)

    - interesting date ideas: flowers, quad restaurants (high rise), Berryline

  - reasons people didn't participate:
    - most people aren't risk takers
    - even people in relationships who acknowledged DM shouldn't be taken seriously didn't sign up
    - only way to fix this is to keep working on the FOMO angle of Datamatch
      - "Don't Miss Out!" and "All Your Friends Are Doing It!" etc. language in emails and social media etc.

## Publicity
- Social media
  - FB
    - page, event
      - honestly these two things should cover 75% of the heavy lifting

    - start spamming your wall

  - Twitter
    - if HCS has an account, start spamming that

  - Snapchat / Quora / Reddit / LinkedIn / Your CS section
    - I don't care what it is, start spamming that

- Email
  - assigned email lists
    - everyone should know their duties AHEAD of time

  - see UC mail-merge bullet
  - two emails: initial announce and results announce
  - I'll create the template myself and get that to you soon
    - does board have a specific timeframe they need this by?

- Postering
  - assigned locations (same idea as email)
  - I need a designer
    - I'll have mock templates and poster ideas, but I need a graphic designer to smooth things out

- Other
  - HUDS board
  - "sample questions" (I need to work on this)
