## Discussion

### Algorithm

- Jay and Jason split up tasks
- heap probably not even necessary...
  - funny story: heap implemented b/c faster than nlogn sort; but heap was implemented in nlogn time...

### Website

- Alex: request for design to be done by someone else
  - mocked design is mainly good, except for font and select tag display
- continuing progress on endpoints
- user POST endpoints just need to return status and errors

### Pubbing

- possible slogans: "FTW" (for the waffle; friends through waffles)
- possible terminology: bae, match
