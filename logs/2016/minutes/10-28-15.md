## Discussion

- "Date" connotation
  - default message of completely *casual*
  - how to control message?
    - Pubbing emails not super effective
    - FB event!
    - Acronym/motto: easy to remember, easily reinforces idea
    - in previous years, only slightly remembered: esp. enforced this year
    - as long as we make clear casual is default, people will escalate as necessary
    - 3 tiers of:
      1. "hook up culture" (explicit date)
      2. "untinder" (casual date)
      3. "waffle date" (not really a date; just a casual meeting)
    - so don't use word "date"--come up with another phrase!
      - "friend date" or "waffle date"?

    - compare post-14th side, which is more complicated
