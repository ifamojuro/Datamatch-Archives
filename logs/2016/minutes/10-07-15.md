# Datamatch 2016 10/7/15 Meeting Minutes

## Stuff to Get Out of the Way

- some leadership stuff i forgot from last week
  - it is my first time leading dm myself
  - so if you're ever unhappy (too fast? too slow?), let me know
- Alex wasn't here last time, so he should intro himself
- check that everyone has DM Rails sites working

## MVC/DB/Routes Intro
- Again, if I go too fast, too slow, let me know
- Open DM rails code to follow along
  - open slack, too, so I can paste code
- Models (app/models)
  - primary objects of the site
  - the database (db/)
    - schema (db/schema.rb)/migrations (db/migrate)/columns
    - typical DB (foreign keys, column types)
    - contrast w/ actual models (e.g. relation defs, methods)
      - DB tables != models
    - ActiveRecord
  - both a conceptual and practical building block of site
  - main DM model is User
- Controllers (app/controllers)
  - central organizers
  - "decide what happens"
  - employs models in code; generates views
  - main DM controller is DatamatchController
- Views (app/views)
  - the "pages" that actually appear
  - html or js (any format, really; see controllers)
  - "embedded ruby"
    - data from controller
  - layouts/partials
- Routes (routes.rb)
  - url generation
    - "rake routes" (or an invalid url)
  - CRUD
    - resources :model

### MVC/DB/Routes Examples
- We'll use Events as our teaching example.
- Models
  - name all the models Event "possesses"
  - name all the columns of Event that are strings
  - I want to get the currently running event. Give me the ruby that does this.
- Controllers
  - None of you have admin accounts. (actually, you have no accounts at all)
  - What's the only Event page you can view?
- Views
  - What rows should be displayed at that page?
- Routes
  - What's the url of that page?
  - What do you actually see?

    - also, black background with dynamic colors in the middle
      - splash page like what Alex has with the bouncing hearts
      - fades to colors inside?
  - logo
    - no HCS
      - yeah, but that's not a problem
    - pixel-ly logo
    - text: just "Datamatch"
    - same on the splash page and the header

    - "fun"
      - survey research for what's "fun"
- Jay
  - K-nearest neighbors
    - take seed data
      - 5 categories, randomly gen ints
      - classify based on highest cat.
