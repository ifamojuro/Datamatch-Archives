# Datamatch 2016 10/14/15 Meeting Minutes

## An API and a Client

- fully explain API/client separation
  - i.e. why it's nicer to do it this way
  - check for understanding of API
    - endpoints? REST?
  - check for understanding of client
    - JS?
    - how can Alex delegate work?
  - how to connect two? (up to Alex and me, I guess)

- building an API in Rails
  - difference between normal Rails project and API
    - Middleware
    - Views (HTML vs. JSON [jbuilder])
  - the similarities: routes, still MVC
    - refresher: what's MVC stand for?
  - UsersController example
    - note the API comments
      - open doc files
    - what's the MVC?
    - a GET: "/survey"
      - find the "view" yourself
      - what are we doing here? 
        keep in mind the view is the JSON we "return"
        (just read the API comment if you have to)
        - in particular, someone explain what @questions is
    - a POST: "/survey"
      - explain params
      - difference between POST and GET
  - what YOU are doing with APIs moving forward
    - get assignments, gauge experience

## Week in Review

- Jessica (has to come early)
  - view graphic materials
    - main idea of logo theme?
    - upload the materials to Git or slack!
  - other restaurants
    - *emphasize* prize dates
      they are going to happen, and I want to see preparation
- Alex
  - current appearance of website
    - feedback?
    - how flexible? how easy to add tabs? to add behavior? pages?
    - how to get other members involved?
  - integration with Jessica's colors
    - point to *specific* locations for integration
    - CSS? how does this work with React? (quick primer)

- Annie
  - Pinker
    - who's going
    - questions to ask AS A WAY of figuring what *we* care about
    - questions to ask:
      - what makes people like their dates?
        - See Bowen meeting notes
          - esp. "serious" questions
        - by far the most import. question: spend most time on it
      - what makes people use the site?
      - get permission to cite him
  - Survey
    - review questions presented
    - any others needed?
      - consider appearance, website flow, algo. design
      - especially what would be "dealbreakers" with using site

- Promit and Jay
  - progress on algorithm
    - we **really** need to start making code progress here
    - not to sound angry, but...
  - Algorithm Overview (how results get coded)
    - BUCKETS (everywhere)
    - one half done as we always have
      - vectors, numpy, etc.
    - one half "collated"
      - a "playlist" DJed by us
      - house close; house far; etc.
      - same idea with serious questions
    - machine learning?
      - a futile effort
      - we're going to still collect the data... 
        (since it's psychologically good)
      - but not really use it
    - crucial part is creating method skeletons for those two halves

- Other minor points:
  - social media--it's happening!
  - blind dates, but ONE blind date
    - in addition to, or in replacement of, top match?

## Discussion

- Jessica left early; Jay sick
  - Design
    - Fonts: heavy/middle preferred
    - Logo:
      - text: acrostic off-center
      - uppercase for now, dependent on how animation goes
      - color: depends on background of website
      - Small Logo:
        - DM to the right; or D on left, M on right
    - Color scheme
      - dark navbar, light background
      - best color scheme out of discussion:
        - background color (primary color): #EF798A
        - navbar color (secondary color): #8F0000
- Alex: see website
- Annie
  - Pinker meeting
    - Pinker's office
    - 4:30 PM
    - Jessica, Promit, Raynor (maybe)
    - "what makes people like each other"
    - "what makes people use/not use the site"
    - see 36 Questions to Fall in Love With Someone
      - (suggest people use them as conversation topics)
      - actuall, repeat that: *conversation topics*!
    - get permission!
  - Survey
    - incentivize
      - "unlock" from last year
    - logistics: google form, surveymonkey
    - as pubbing material: have new logo
    - actual questions:
      - "did you go on the date"
        - branch based on this answer
      - level of uncomfortablness w/ site
  - Promit and Jay
  - Algorithm
    - Bucket all users
      - Year: Undergrad, Grad, Alumni
      - (buckets within that bucket) Preference: Not likely to date, shallow, likely to date
    - 2/3 of list: Euclidean distance
      - based on code from last year (C++)
      - still use clever weighting
    - 1/3 of list: "playlist of matches"
      - compiled matches based on human-chosen criteria
        - same House+Year; far House+same Year
        - same answers to serious questions
        - exact opposite answers to serious questions
        - be flexible!
    - Skeleton code!
