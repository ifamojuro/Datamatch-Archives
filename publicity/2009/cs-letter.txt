Subject: Announcing the Return of Datamatch!

Does your typical Valentine's Day look like this?

while (February 14th) {
    remember past breakups while walking to class;
    scratch out misshapen hearts while (not) listening to section;
    cuddle up with safety blanket when no one is looking;
    look down nose on best friend's mountain of Valentine's gifts;
    if (true)
        burst into tears;
}

service to distract, amuse and serenade you away from your troubles
