Are you tired of awkward first dates, endless rejections and drunken gyrations somewhere in Pfoho? Dismayed by the high cost of mail-order spouses? Finding yourself stymied by a confusing and restrictive core curriculum?

Then visit http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/datamatch today.

The Harvard Computer Society is proud to announce the return of Datamatch, Harvard's once and future computer dating service. Our proprietary artificial intelligence system, powered by programming code so complex that no one person understands it all and by computers so powerful that we had to lock them in a cage buried below campus, will match you with the people on campus with whom you are most compatible. Guaranteed.

Just complete our quick, astonishingly witty survey by 11:59 PM on February 13 and you'll receive an email with the identities of your ten Harvard soulmates before you head off to class on the 14th. This Valentine's, don't spend the day sobbing into your roommate's sweater. Spend it on your computer, surfing the Facebook and emailing people you've never met, all thanks to Datamatch. If you're suffering from a broken heart, don't visit your overpriced cardiologist. Visit Datamatch, 100% free of charge since 1994.

Our algorithm, equipped with over a decade's worth of information on the Harvard dating scene, is simply better at matchmaking than you or any of your friends could ever hope to be. History is full of losers who took on machines and failed miserably, embarrassing their friends and families. Do you want to see your well-meaning blockmate who knows the perfect guy or girl for you die with a hammer in her hand or, worse yet, devote her life to some quixotic struggle to prevent the return of totalitarianism to Russia under Vladimir Putin? I didn't think so.

So try Datamatch today at http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/datamatch
