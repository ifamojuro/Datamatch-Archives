Thanks for participating in Datamatch,   |
co-sponsored by the Harvard Computer     |
Society and the Undergraduate Council.   |
Your results, carefully tabulated by     |
abacus and calibrated by slide rule, are |
below. You're under no obligation to     |
even contact the people on your list,    |
but, what the heck, maybe something      |
good will come out of it! Thank you to   |
all the 1064 males and 1117 females who  |
participated!                            |
                                         |
Happy Valentine's Day,                   |
