Cyberlove, Harvard style
By Susan Ashley 

Happy Valentine's Day! Love is in the air, but because many of us find that it doesn't often waft our way, the Harvard Computer Society (HCS) and the Undergraduate Council (UC) helped us out by bringing us Datamatch again this year. Participants of the online survey received a list of names of the students determined to be most compatible with them based on their responses.

Or not. Bryan Parno '03, the Projects Coordinator for HCS and overseer of the Datamatch project, indicated that the process may have no rationale at all.

"The matching algorithm employs advanced statistical modeling and years of psychological studies to reduce the art of match making to an exact science. Or maybe it's just a random number generator. We really can't say." 

The results, e-mailed this balmy Valentine's Morning, wait slyly in students' inboxes as matchees debate what to do about them. Parno claimed that he has "heard of a few dates, blind dates, and even relationships that developed as a direct result of Datamatch." After consulting the facebook and the recommendations of friends, some may decide the thrill of the survey was quite enough, but others may send out tentative emails or even phone calls in hopes of connecting with their suspiciously selected soul mates. 

Last year's survey received over 2,200 responses and as of Sunday night, 1,400 people had answered this year's call. Though a possibly fishy survey may seem an unorthodox method for catching a date, Parno reported that "Feedback regarding the survey is overwhelmingly positivewho doesn't enjoy an amusing outlet for procrastination?" 

But there may be a deeper emotion revealed in the survey's popularity. Last year's results found that at this school of hopeless romantics, the plurality of students (830 men and 938 women) defined love as choice D: "special and rare, but real." Students' belief in true love seems to drive them to desperate measures, and at Harvard, where the dating scene is notoriously frigid, Datamatch may be the perfect low risk entre into a more promising love life. 

At the same time, students responding to Datamatch keep their hopes realistic. The most common answer to the last question, "How serious of a relationship are you looking for?" was C: "A date to the formal," drawing 441 men and 602 women, while only one third that number of males and one fourth that number of females admitted to wanting choice E: "a ring." 

The survey also exposes a useful preference for topping off that date with the Datamatch special friend: last year both men and women overwhelmingly selected chocolate body paint as their favorite sex toy. Sounds like a job for Fare Harvard. 

So come on. How do they really match up respondents? Can one's true love really be discovered by an inscrutable but equally indisputable computer algorithm, or is love such a mystery that a random assignment is as likely to unite two people as any careful correlation? Parno claimed that "The questions are highly tuned to reach deep within each person's soul and draw out the hidden factors that truly characterize their unique personality." Beyond that, the cagey Project Coordinator refused to venture. His final answer: "I wouldn't want to influence the way people respond to the questions. You just have to accept Datamatch on faith; after all, the course of true love never did run smooth."

Here's a transcript of email between myself and an Indy reporter.  It contains answers to some of the common questions about datamatch and might be helpful in providing publicity in future years.


Dear Bryan,

Thank you so much for all your help. This has been a really amusing article
to research and write thanks to your responses. Look for the final product
in this Thursday's issue of the Indy.

Susan
